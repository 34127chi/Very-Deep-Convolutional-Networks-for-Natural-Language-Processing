## Implementation of the paper Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Natural Language Processing in Tensorflow 

This is the implementation of the paper **Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Natural Language Processing** of **A. Conneau et al (2016)** in Tensorflow. This code doesn't employ shorcut because the best performance is observed in 29 layers without shortcut. It's free to choose the embedding size of vector so here it is initialized by one-hot-vector of alphabet's dictionary. The model is evaluated on Twitter data set [4].

## Empirical results

We study in the paper the importance of depth in convolutional models for text classification, either when character or word inputs are considered. We show on 5 standard text classification and sentiment analysis tasks that deep models indeed give better performances than shallow networks when the text input is represented as a sequence of characters. However, a simple shallow-and-wide network outperforms deep models such as DenseNet with word inputs. Our shallow word model further establishes new state-of-the-art performances on two datasets: Yelp Binary (95.9\%) and Yelp Full (64.9\%).
